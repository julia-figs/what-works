<h4>Background story</h4>

<p>This workshop is based on the idea that we can learn through stories. And to explain how the workshop will run, I want to tell you a story. If you find it interesting then I would like to invite you to attend our event. The details, and a link to register, are at the bottom of this document, and also on the front page of the website.</p>

<p>Over the last few years, my colleagues and I have run a number of workshops focusing on finding new ways to overcome the major obstacles that hinder underrepresented groups from studying biology. Interesting ideas have emerged from these workshops, and progress is definitely being made. However, through running these events we became aware that many faculty members had developed their own personal &lsquo;bag of tricks&rsquo; that helped them mentor their students in all sorts of interesting and effective ways. We also learned that these faculty tended not to talk about their techniques, because they all seemed so obvious that they thought everyone must know about them already.</p>

<p>So, about a year ago we approached the NSF with a very simple proposal. We wanted to find and interview these faculty members so that we could document what actually worked. It&rsquo;s important to note that we saw this as being very tactically focused. The stories we wanted to collect were not going to change an institution&rsquo;s strategy. Rather, they would be aimed at answering the question, &ldquo;What one thing could I do today that might broaden participation?&rdquo; Fortunately, the NSF&rsquo;s Biology directorate supported our idea, and we set to work.</p>

<p>Over the last year we have had the chance to talk with many interesting, enthusiastic, and ingenious people. We have gathered stories, and tried to summarize what&rsquo;s working. We definitely haven&rsquo;t finished the process, but we are now at a stage where we want to share the stories, build a community, and amplify the effects of these bags of tricks. And that&rsquo;s why we are running a workshop.</p>

<h4>What are we going to do?</h4>

<p>We want to attract 20-30 curious, enthusiastic participants who are prepared to share stories (large or small) about what has worked for them. As you have probably guessed by now, this workshop will not involve lectures! Instead, we will spend a day together learning from successes, forming new partnerships, and inventing new tactics. Travel and accommodation expenses (air travel, one-night stay at a hotel, mileage, ground transportation, food), for attending our one-day pre conference workshop will be covered by our NSF grant. The event will be held at the same location as the main SACNAS conference.<br />
